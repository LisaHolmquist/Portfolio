        <h2>The Problem:</h2>
        <p1>Prime Video currently is not organized in a way that encourages users to use it and has no incentive for users to utilize it as their primary streaming service.</p1>
    
        <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
        <p1>The team went into this case study with the idea that a redesign was needed for the browser version of Prime Video. This platform was unorganized, chaotic, and difficult to use for users. However, we quickly found that the smart tv was the primary platform for streaming consumption and this platform was very user friendly. The team had to pivot several times in order to create a polished and thoughtful redesign that was in great need by Prime Video users.</p1>
    
        <h2>The Solution:</h2>
        <p1>Understand the kind of experience that users need and desire when choosing their primary streaming service. Finding a way, through research, to innovate the streaming service experience to position Prime Video as the primary streaming service.</p1>

            <h3>Understanding The Users</h3>
                <h4>Proto-persona:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We began our research process with the need to understand what our users mental model consisted of when it came to streaming services. What was it that our users were looking for? What have they come to expect as a standard practive in streaming services? How does our user perceive Amazon Prime Video currently?</p2> 
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">    
                        <p2>We first decided to create a proto-persona in order to target the assumptions we may already be making about our users and formulate a research plan accordingly.</p2> 
                    </div>
                    <div class="row images">   
                        <div class="column text-center">

                    </div>
                <h4>Research Plan:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>After creating our proto-persona we found that we were making the following assumptions about our users:</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>1. Users don't find the current service intuitive and don't use it as their primary streaming service.<br>2. Users like streaming services.<br>3. Streaming services are their main platform for movie and series entertainment.<br>4. Users are looking for something specific on Prime Video. Not just browsing.<br>5. Users use Prime Video as a "last resort" when unable to find a desired show/movie on their primary streaming service.</p2>
                    </div> 
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Due to these assumptions, we felt we needed to discover when a why users visit Prime Video and their general sentiment towards the service. The following research questions resulted:</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>1. Describe your favorite features of your preferred primary video streaming service.<br>2. What is a "must-have" feature for a streaming service you're considering?<br>3. Are you the primary account holder of your chosen streaming service? Why or why not?<br>    a. If you are not the primary account holder and the account was removed, would you become the primary account holder? Why or why not?<br>4. Describe positive and negative experiences with Prime Video.<br>5. In what scenarios do you find yourself visiting Prime Video?</p2>

                <h4>Survey:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Parallel to our research interviews, we also carefully crafted a survey to understand what it is that users look for in a primary streaming service. We also chose to ask demographic questions in order to understand further nuance and potential divide in the current user base of Prime Video as well as which streaming service participants consider their primary service currently to grant us the ability to narrow our competitive analysis later to the primary competitors.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We had a total of 97 respondents. We found the following results the most impactful for our design decision making:</p2>

                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>When we initially began this project, we were planning on doing a general redesign of the browser version of Prime Video. However, after seeing the results of this survey, we saw the the great majority of users use a Smart TV as their chosen platform to stream content. At this point, we decided to shift our attention to the Smart TV for this redesign and new feature integration design process.</p2>
                    </div>   
            <h3>Supplemental Research</h3>
                <h4>Competitor Analysis:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Our survey indicated that users' primary streaming services are 57.7% Netflix, 15.5% Hulu, and 13.4% HBO Max with all other streaming services making up the last 13.4%. Knowing this information, we primary aimed our competitor analysis towards Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max. We felt it vital to the design process to understand the current model of the most popular streaming services. How are these services organized? What makes these services special (are there any unique qualities to these services?) How are these streaming services positioned in a branding sense?</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>The following conclusions resulted:</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="column text-center">
                            <img src="Completitor Analysis.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Competitor Analysis">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                <h4>Heuristic Evaluation:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We initially did a heuristic evaluation on the browser version of Prime Video early on in our design process. However, after our user intervices and survey results were compiles, we felt it prudent to redo a heuristic evaluation of the smart tv app. We gathered images of different screens of the tv app and evaluated the current state of organization, aesthetic consistency and choices, and ease of user flow.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>In doing this evaluation we came to find that only small changes needed to be done in reorganization and the overall state of the app was user friendly and well organized. However, we recognized that users still do not utilize Prime Video as their primary streaming service. Therefore, we decided that Prime Video was in need of branding respositioning with a unique identity appealing to the current and potential users of streaming services.</p2>
                    </div>
            <h3>Research Conclusions</h3>
                <h4>Primary Takeaway:</h4>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>Research concluded that users didn't have major issues with Amazon Prime Video and that no major redesign was necessary. The primary issue is that Prime Video is considered a rental service or "last resort" streaming service. Our team wanted to change this narrative by creating new features that would make users return to Prime Video consistently.</p2>
                    </div>
                <h4>Nuances Found in Research:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>After compiling our research, we discussed as a team some possible behavioral and mental nuances that may exist between the lines of our research. The following points were generally agreed upon:</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>1. User's main considerations when choosing streaming services were ease of use, price, and exclusive content.<br>2. Users don't enjoy the need to rent movies if they already have a subscription.<br>3. All users we interviewed and surveyed shared their subscriptions with family/friends.<br>4. Age and financial standing may contribute to users not being the primary account holders.<br>5. Ease of use was the largest consideration when choosing a streaming service and the majority of complaints we received about Prime Video specifically were related to ease of use. We concluded that theis may be ont he the primary reasons that Prime Video is seen as a "last resort" streaming service.</p2>
                    </div>
                <h4>Insight & Problem Statements:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>In order to narrow our focus as a group and fully understand the problem we are solving as a team we, together, wrote the following insight and problem statements.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Insight Statement:<br>People who use streaming services need the ability to share account subscriptions, browse content casually and easily, and have exclusive content on the platform.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>Problem Statement:<br>How might we change the current perception and usage of Prime Video to bring users a friendly, intuitive, and tailored experience causing them to return to prime video to browse as their primary streaming service in the future?</p2>
                    </div>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <h4>Initial Ideation:</h4>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>After feeling like we had a firm grasp on user's expectations and pain points, we used the "I like, I wish, I wonder" model to begin our feature ideation. We then voted anonymously as a group on our favorite feature ideas.</p2>
                    </div>
                <h4>Feature Prioritization Matrix:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We then placed these ideas on a prioritization matrix as a group. This consisted of an x-axis from low impact to high impact for users and a y-axis of low complexity to high complexity for us to implement. The matrix can be seen below.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="column text-center images">
                            <img src="Feature Prioritization.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Feature Prioritization Matrix">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We found, however, we had quite a few ideas that we deemed "high impact." We then recognized, with a limited timeframe, it would be unrealistic to implement all the feature ideas we had and have a polished product on the other end. With this in mind, we grouped some ideas together that we felt fit under the same overarching idea and discussed, once again, our research results and what we felt would be most impactful for our users. We recalled at this time, the fact that most users share their subscriptions with friends/family. We came to the conclusion that it would be wise to embrace this fact and possibly build upon it so that users can be more social with their streaming services, especially with those they share a subscription with. With these things in mind, we conducted another round of group voting in order to narrow our scope for this project.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>The following three feature ideas resulted:<br>1. "What if Prime Video created a virtual hang out night with fun movie questions, games, and discounts on snacks so friends could feel together while apart?"<br>2. "I wonder if I could 'share' or 'recommend' shows and movies that I liked to the other profiles that are using the same account."<br>3. "What if Prime Video made a specialized trivia game for you each week based off the shows and movies you watched?"</p2>
                    </div>
            <h3>Initial Prototyping</h3>
                <h4>The Homescreen:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We felt it most prudent to add a "Social" tab to the homescreen, both on the left navigation menu as well as the tabs already established above the mian content that currently listed "Movies", "TV", and "Sports." We initially created this tab leading to the user's social profile and friends list screens.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class-="row">
                        <div class="column text-center images">

                    </div>
                <h4>User Profile and Friend Profile:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>The added social tab on the homescreen led to the user social profile. This profile displayed your recommended series and movie of the month, your current running trivia score, content recommendations from your friends list and the top rated content from your friends list. The user can also navigate to the friend's profile fromt his page to see their recommendations and recently watched content.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>This feature gave users more options/recommmendations from trusted friends and family. Now users can stay in the loop with what friends and family are watching.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">

                <h4>Searching for a Friend:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>This screen came up in several places with the added social feature. This was brought up when starting watch parties, finding a current friend fromt he user's social profile, and when adding a new friend.</p2>

                <h4>Monthly Trivia:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>This feature was designed with inspiration from Jackbox Games, in which the user can play in the same locations as their friends with their combined watched content. The friends on the couch would play the game from their mobile device and the primary account holder would play on the tv. Due to this, two flows were created, a television screen flow, using a tv controller to answer the trivia questions, and a mobile flow fot the other users to answer the trivia questions. Some of these screens can be seen below - trivia quesitons pulled from IMDb, which is an Amazon owned company as we felt it prudent to utilize Amazon's current assets.</p2>

                        <p2>The foal of this round of usability testing was to understand how intuitive the intial user flow s were, if the new features were easy to understaand, and discover potential pain points.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>A total of six tests were conducted and each participant was given three tasks to complete:</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>1. How long does it take for users to recommend a show to their friends? How long does it take for users to find a friends profile?<br>2. How would you go about starting a new trivia game?<br>3. Do you understand how to start a watch party? Would you be able to accept a watch party invitation?</p2>
                    </div>
                <h4>Lo-fi User Testing Results:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Overall, there was a 76.6% success rate in completing the tasks outlined for the participants.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>The team discovered the following:</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Task 1:<br>1. Participants found the icons on the content preiview screen to be confusing when recommending a show to friends.<br>2. All 6 participants said they watch the recommendations given to them by friends.<br>3. 3 participants said they are likely to send a friend a text if they had a recommendation for that specific friend. Most the recommendations came up organically in conversation.<br>4. 2 participants wished that the feature worked on the profile level rather than the account level.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Task 2:<br>1. 3 participants said they are more likely to play trivia with friends virtually.<br>2. 3 participants would play trivia if there were incentives.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>Task 3:<br>1. Most participants expect to navigate to the watch party screens from the homescreen or from the movie itself. They did not immediately assume it was under the social tab, although they did eventually find it.<br>2. Participants were split on if they would use this feature, use of the feature is situational, likely when friends don't live near each other.<br>3. 2 participants felt they needed more information on how the watch party worked.</p2>
                    </div>
                <h4>Feature Survey:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Towards the end of our initial round of designing, we were beginning to worry if, despite narrowing our scope, we were spreading ourselces too thin given our timeline and wanted to measure user interest in the features we settled upon.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>The lo-fi suvey asked respondents to rank the three new features based off of interest and use.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>There were 41 respondents, the results were as follows:</p2>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>It was clear the feautres that respondents were most interested in was the adding and shairing with friends feature, the interest in trivia and watch parties was relatively split.</p2>
                    </div>
            <h3>Mid-fi Prototype Iterations</h3>
                <h4>Recommend a Show:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We streamlined the user flow here for less screens and navigation needed. We recognized that navigation from a tv controller is difficult and so we wanted to simplify the user flows as much as possible. We also had the "recommend" icon recommend the given contnet to the user's entire friend list rather than having to search for individual friends.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">

                <h4>Watch Party:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Most of the changes in this flow from lo-fi to mid-fi were aesthetic including iconography, visual friends list, and imagery. We also briefly discussed, at this stage, a possible needed change to the screen for adding friends to the watch party. Directional buttons on the tv controller were likely to be used here and continuously clicking the left direcitonal arrow to go from one side of the screen to the other could prove tedious for users.</p2>

                        <p2>As previously mentioned in log-fi usability testing, we discovered that participants desired more incentives for participating in monthly trivia, so this page was updated accordingly.</p2>

                <h4>Icon A/B Testing:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We struggled slightly with deciding on a few select icons. We found in our initial heuristic evaluation that iconography was an area that seemed a little unclear in the current design on Prime Video and wanted to ensure that any new icons we introduced were dear in purpose.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>One such icon was the watch party icon. Currently, this icon is a small confetti icon. However, we found that the majority of users didn't know that this feature existed due to the current icon. With this information we decided to change the icon to a simple image of friends. However, in lo-fi and mid-fi testing this was easily confused with sharing with friends so we did some A/B testing using an icon of a tv with two friends. Users expressed that this one was more clear.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">

                <h4>Mid-fi User Testing Plan:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Six new users participated in usability testing for the mid-fi prototype. The objectives of the test had minor tweaks from the first round of testing in order to further understand overall usability at this stage of the design process.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>The tasks were as follows:<br>1. How long does it take for users to recommend a show to their friends? How long does it take for users to add a new friend?<br>2. How would you go about starting a new trivia game? Are you more likely to play alone or with friends?<br>3. Do you understand how to start a watch party based off the icon bar on the starting or paused movie screen?</p2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>The team discovered the following:</p2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Task 1:<br>1. Participants were able to add friends with ease.<br>2. Participants were able to recommend shows to friends.</p2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Task 2:<br>1. Particpants were able to find and play trivia.<br>2. Participants concluded that they enjoyed the incentive of winning prizes, but that the incentive screen was hard to read as it disappeared too fast.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>Task 3:<br>1. Watch party was enjoyable but the icons were a bit confusing.<br>2. Participants were confused on how to accept an invitation.<br>    a. Didn't realize it would be on the social page.</p2>
                    </div>
            <h3>Final Iterations</h3>
                <h4>Watch Party Invitation Flow:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We added a step when navigating to the social profile to select the profile in the acount that the user is accessing. This was added to solve previous user feedback regarding using the general account versus an individual profile on the account. However, in mid-fi testing, many participants got stuck here with a few stating that they thought that step was implied before even reaching the homescreen. With this feedback in mind, we rearranged the flow of profile selection to before the homescreen.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We also had some confusion in mid-fi testing as watch party invitations were in the social profile screen. However, all participants first attempted navigation through the "Watch Party" tab rather than the "Social" tab. In the final prototype, we movied the watch party invitation to the "Watch Party" tab to avoid this confusion.</p2>

                <h4>Friend Selection:</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>One challenge we faced was streamlining each screen to have as few components as possible. This was for the sake of clarity as well as the fact that users will be using a tv remote when interacting with the interface which is much more difficult for basic navigation.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>In this case, our screen to add friends to invite to a watch party had many components and felt convoluted for basic navigation. We then refined our design in our hi-fi iteration to streamline this process.</p2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>Although, the mid-fi prototype had the trivia incentives screen slowed down, users still expressed confusion regarding what they were looking at and couldn't recall at the end of the flow what the incentives were for playing.</p2>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>With this feedback, we redesigned the incentives screen with several animated components to show what content was recently watched for their trivia and then bring in the incentives afterward. This would direct the users eye as desired in order to fully comprehend all information presented on this screen. A "Start Game" button was also added to this screen did not automatically pass, giving the user time to mentally prepare for trivia questions starting and also to allow the user to take in any and all information on the screen.</p2>

                        <p2>After all user flows were built, we took a pass over everything in the prototype to (1) ensure that everything worked properly, especially when taking paths that were not originally intended for the user and (2) to ensure consistency in brand identity and design aesthetic.</p2>

                        <p2>We did a lot of research at the beginning of the project to fully understand what Amazon's established branding consisted of. We found obvious branding components such as specific color palettes and fonts, but we also found a few things that were much more specific such as the degree of curve on the corners of the rectangular components, hover states, and button sizes. Understanding Amazon's current brand identity helped us ensure branding consistency as well as an overall design ecosystem that made sense in each user flow.</p2>

            <h3>Final Thoughts & Future Opportunities</h3>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>During user interviews, some participants mentioned wanting a feature for making content that was watched in-person with friends that could then be watched independently. The team created designs for this but becuase the feature is very situational, we did not pursue it further. We would like to have further research on the subject and potentially add this feature in a later stage.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p2>We would like to discuss with Amazon how they would like to handle watch parties with non Amazon Prime members as this could be a potential business concern.</p2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row bottomPar">
                        <p2>Finally, we had many other feature ideas that we felt would also fit within this repositioning of Prime Video that we feel would be worth exploring with further research and design sprints.</p2>
